How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is quite easy and less time consuming to find a difference by using the command fc firstfile secondfile

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By knowing that how this version is better than the previous one, and also what I have learned from last verison till now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros for manually choosing whenever we made a logical change or whenever we want to save that version we commit with proper readme.
    Cons it will take time to manually commit .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because git is basically used for save versions of code and in coding many files are connected to each other and have same lines of code so if we want to make some changes in all the files we can do it and commit it once

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By the help of git log we will be able to see all the commits and by the git diff we can see the difference between files 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By using the command git checkout we can keep track fromw hich commit error is been introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   I want to keep all my code on the git so that i can check how i am improving my programming skills by checkimg my commits
